                        <h3>Competitive Pricing</h3>
                        <p>At Jack's, your time is your money. Our easy-to-use system starts at just $1, and continues at $1 per minute — no hidden fees. Whether you pay with quarters, dollar coins, or tap your card or phone, you're in full control. Credit payments activate a count-up timer, so you decide when to stop. Cash users enjoy a count-down timer that can be extended with additional coins. Simple, transparent, and customer-first.</p>

                        <h3>Wax & Polish</h3>
                        <p>Bring out the best in your car's paint with our polish and wax options. The foam conditioner restores surface shine, while the wax locks it in and repels water long after your wash. Our system accommodates both new and older vehicles — if you've got a factory clear coat, polish and wax are optional. But when you want that showroom finish, we’ve got the tools to make it happen.</p>

                        <h3>Spot-Free Rinse</h3>
                        <p>Our best feature? A soft water double reverse osmosis system built for a facility twice our size. This ensures that your final rinse is as pure and clean as it gets. The result: fewer spots, quicker drying, and no streaks. If you've ever been frustrated by water marks, you'll appreciate the difference our system makes.</p>

                        <h3>Self-Serve Control</h3>
                        <p>Each bay is equipped with a user-friendly dial system. Switch between wheel cleaner, pre-soak, high-pressure soap, foam brush, conditioner polish, wax, and spot-free rinse — all at your pace. The pressure is strong enough to clean effectively without damaging your car’s finish, and the real hog's hair foam brushes offer friction without scratching.</p>

                        <h3>Eco-Friendly Water Use</h3>
                        <p>Our reverse osmosis system is so picky, it rejects hundreds of gallons of clean water every day — and we don’t let it go to waste. That water is captured and used in our high-pressure rinse. We also use drip irrigation for landscaping and maintain leak-free plumbing. It's clean for your car, and cleaner for the planet.</p>
